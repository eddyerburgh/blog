In this tutorial you will learn how to style a css only flip toggle switch, like the ones below .

## The Problem With Styling Checkboxes

First time I tried to style a checkbox I was shocked - my CSS wasn't doing anything! A bit of Googling told that checkboxes are <a rel="noopener" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4148499/how-to-style-checkbox-using-css">notoriously difficult to style</a>. Browsers are inconsistent in applying styles to form elements like checkboxes, and **CSS2 isn't expressive enough to style these complex elements**. Check out how this togglebox gets rendered by different browsers:

WTF?! *That's* why we're **not going to style the checkbox**. Instead, we'll hide the checkbox and style a label element that's much easier to work with.

## The HTML

```html
<input id="toggle" type="checkbox">
<label for="toggle">
<div id="switch"></div>
</label>
```

This is the minimum HTML you need to use this technique. The label has to either be a direct sibling of the input, or an ancestor of it. If you have no control over HTML (when styling HTML generated by a WordPress plugin for example), and it's arranged in another way, this technique will not work. You'll have to use JavaScript.

### Input

This is our form element. It's what registers checks and passes that info on when the form is submitted. The reason it is before the label and the div element is so that we can style both of those using the :checked pseudo selector, which can only style elements that come after it in the document structure (more on that later ;) ).

### Label

This is what we're going to style. We use the for attribute to link it with the checkbox, so that when the label is clicked the checkbox changes state.

### Div

This is going to be the button that toggles between the left and right of the container.

## Styling the Flip Toggle Switch

```css
#toggle {
 opacity: 0;
}
#label {
 display: inline-block;
 background: #2c3e50;
 width: 2em;
 height: 1em;
 border-radius: 0.5em;
 position: relative;
 cursor: pointer;
 background: #2c3e50;
}
#switch {
 position: absolute;
 width: 0.9em;
 height: 0.9em;
 margin-top: 0.05em;
 margin-left: 0.05em;
 border-radius: 1em;
 background: #c0392b;
 box-shadow: 5px 0px 28px -9px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.75);
 transition: transform .2s ease-in;
}
#toggle:checked ~ #label #switch {
 background: #2ecc71;
 transform: translatex(1em);
 transition: transform .2s ease-in;
}
/* Unimportant styles */
.container {
 max-width: 1080px;
 margin: 0 auto;
 padding-top: 10%;
 text-align: center;
}
body {
 font-size: 120px;
}
```

### What's happening?

We hide the checkbox by setting it's opacity to 0. This means it can still be read by screen readers. We then style the label as the background the switch will toggle on. Remember, the label is linked to the checkbox, so clicking it changes the state of the checkbox. We then style the div#switch as the switch that will change position when the label is clicked.

Now for the next stage. It's the pseudo selector :checked that lets us create a CSS only flip toggle switch. Since the checkbox comes before the label element, we can style the label and the switch when the checkbox is in the :checked state. By using CSS transforms and transitions we can make the div#switch appear to toggle between on and off.
